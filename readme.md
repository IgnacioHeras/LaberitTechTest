# Technical test for LABERIT
This consists in a test for Laberit. Here i have created an API with a MongoDB secured by basic auth, i will show you how to instal this to be able to test it in your own.

# Installation
## 1 Download the code
You should git clone https://github.com/IgnacioHeras/LaberitTechTest
Then follow these steps
```bash
cd LaberitTechTest
npm install
```
In case you get any errors from modules not found or something similar, you should do
```bash
npm i mongoose express mongodb-memory-server express-basic-auth
```
Now just run it!
```bash
node .\index.js
```
## 2 Test API

You need to CURL the API to TEST it, as its Database (MongoDB) its created on memory it will flush completely every time you run a new instance of the project, please be aware of this.
